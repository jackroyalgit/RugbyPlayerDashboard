## Markdown for doing EDA on the Rugby Dataset

```{r}
#Ideas for plots - add to readme
#Plot by team top ten matches group by team
rugby <- read.csv("RugbyPlayerDataESPN1.csv")
#Scroll bar to select how many players you want to see
number <- 10
teamselect <- "NZ"
attribute <- Mat
Top10 <- rugby %>% filter(Team == teamselect) %>% top_n(number, Mat)

ggplot(Top10, aes(x = reorder(Player,-Mat,sum),y = Mat)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")

```
